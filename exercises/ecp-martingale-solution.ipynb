The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. \n","\n","The martingale strategy has also been applied to roulette, where the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%. \n","\n","The following video describes the strategy in detail, as well as discusses why it is not going to bring you any money: https://youtu.be/YfGgHxrSBhY\n","\n","In this notebook, you task will be to simulate  the process of the martingale betting and study the resulting wins and losses."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RTrxsjKNu1kh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616564198349,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":689,"user":{"displayName":"Evgeniya Korneva","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi3T-RGnL1PQrbVo65Sdf0UAOUgrFeg9k6Mt_EM4Q=s64","userId":"12252723452541006363"}}},"source":["import random"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PDcv99Naszub"},"source":["## Modelling the betting strategy\n","\n","First, we need to model the behaviour of the gambler according to the martingale strategy.\n","\n","Suppose that she starts with betting $5 on red.
