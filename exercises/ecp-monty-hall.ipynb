You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n","\n","It turns out this is a trickier problem than it might first appear. Among many others, a very famous mathematician Paul Erdős, got the answer wrong. He had to be convinced with a computer simulation. That’s what we will do now.\n","\n","Simulate the game and then run many trials to see which strategy - switching or sticking to the original choice - makes you win more often."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7aiQa_z7vMea"},"source":["# Number of trials \n","N = 100000\n","\n","# Counter for how many times \n","# the switching strategy wins\n","# (the non-switching strategy will be winning \n","# N - switch_wins times)\n","switch_wins = 0\n","\n","for i in range(N):\n","\n","    # Get the car behind a randm door\n","    doors = ['car', 'goat', 'goat']\n","    random.shuffle(doors)\n","\n","    # Your code here\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
