You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n","\n","It turns out this is a trickier problem than it might first appear. Among many others, a very famous mathematician Paul Erdős, got the answer wrong. He had to be convinced with a computer simulation. That’s what we will do now."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7aiQa_z7vMea","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1641977147275,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":909,"user":{"displayName":"Evgeniya Korneva","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi3T-RGnL1PQrbVo65Sdf0UAOUgrFeg9k6Mt_EM4Q=s64","userId":"12252723452541006363"}}},"source":["import random \n","\n","N = 100000\n","\n","switch_wins = 0\n","\n","for i in range(N):\n","\n","    doors = ['car', 'goat', 'goat']\n","    random.shuffle(doors)\n","\n","    first_guess_ind = random.choice([0, 1, 2])\n","    \n","    first_guess_outcome = doors.pop(first_guess_ind)\n","\n","    doors.remove('goat')\n","\n","    switch_outcome = doors[0]\n","\n","    if switch_outcome is 'car':\n","      switch_wins += 1\n"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"__lZj3EAxtfI","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1641977147280,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Evgeniya Korneva","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi3T-RGnL1PQrbVo65Sdf0UAOUgrFeg9k6Mt_EM4Q=s64","userId":"12252723452541006363"}},"outputId":"d38f3438-52b5-46cd-d520-4d7fcda778b3"},"source":["switch_wins/N"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.66619"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]}]}
